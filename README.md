+ Props to { `Instructor Michelle` } for helping me get the lab initially setup. I was having issues right out the gate, getting past `npm start`. She also continued to get me out of jams....I was shown how to condense codeblocks in vs code in order to see where they end and begin. Incredibly helpful for working with large code bases you have not written/are familiar with yet. Thank you!!!
